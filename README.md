# N-Queens
Genetic Algorithm Solution to the N-Queens problem. <br>
In chess, at each turn a queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally one or more spaces
until it reaches either the edge of the board (8x8 in regular chess) or another piece. When another
piece is encountered in any of the queenâ€™s possible directions of travel, it is said to be threatened.
This program looks for solutions where queens are placed on the chess board such that no queen threatens any other queen.
